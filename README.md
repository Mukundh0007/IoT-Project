# IoT-Project - Smart Parking Management System
- Uses a YOLOv8 to model to achieve number plate detection and pytesseract for OCR 
- Implements reservation of parking spaces for the recognised vehicle in a matrix form and displays availability of spaces.
- Integrates with MQTT (using Paho MQTT) to transfer real time updates
- Employs text to speech with the motivation to allow users to reduce fuel consumptions through giving directions and improve user interactivity

The proposed system aims to optimize parking space utilization, enhance accessibility, and improve overall user experience. 

-Optimized Parking Space Utilization: One of the primary objectives of the smart parking system is to maximize the efficiency of parking space utilization within urban areas. By continuously monitoring parking space availability in real-time using IoT sensors, the system provides users with up-to-date information, enabling them to quickly locate and reserve vacant parking spots. This real-time data also allows parking operators to identify trends and patterns, facilitating more informed decision-making in parking space allocation and management. 

-Security and Reliability: The system's implementation includes robust security measures such as data encryption, secure authentication mechanisms, and continuous monitoring for potential vulnerabilities. These security features protect user data and ensure the integrity of the parking reservation process, instilling confidence in users and stakeholders. 

-Scalability and Future Opportunities: The modular design of the smart parking system allows for scalability and adaptation to different parking facilities and user requirements. As technology evolves, the system can be enhanced with additional features such as predictive analytics, automated payment systems, and integration with smart city initiatives, further improving urban mobility and sustainability. 

-Challenges and Considerations: Despite its benefits, deploying a smart parking system involves challenges such as initial infrastructure investment, technological complexities, and user adoption. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between stakeholders, including municipal authorities, parking operators, technology providers, and end-users, to ensure successful implementation and widespread adoption


Further Improvements:
We aim to incorporate hardware functionalities like boom gate triggering, CO2 emission monitoring, monitoring of parking slot availability, and various payment methods. This endeavor is intended to establish a sustainable parking management system that holds considerable significance. To underscore the importance further, amidst the escalating carbon emissions globally, the adoption of a sustainable parking system is imperative. By enabling features such as pre-booking of parking slots and navigation to available spaces through mobile notifications, we can contribute significantly to sustainable solutions. Even a modest reduction of 3-5% in carbon emissions within society constitutes a substantial improvement.
